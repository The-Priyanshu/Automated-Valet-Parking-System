# Automated-valet-parking-system

## Brief Description
 Nowadays, finding a parking is really a tough job and little expensive too for an average earning person. So we have modified the existing model of automated parking system to make it cost effective.  For making the implementation cost less , we have designed our parking model that will obviously make the parking charges less and will lead to the revolution in the parking world.

We have divided our parking in two parts- Left part is a kind of individual parking system where all the slots needs to be implemented with sensors to manage the data . In the model that is on Right side, we have divided the whole parking into some subparking  areas and  we are monitoring the cars coming in and out at entry level of that subparking. In this model the  requirement of sensors is less ,which will reduce the implement charges.
